# v0.0.0

This is a direct representation of [fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

`FizzBuzz` is easy to understand and use: pass `int` values for `start` and `end`, as well as something implementing
`io.Writer`, and the function will display all results for the range defined by `start` and `end`.

A test has been written to increase confidence in the correctness of `FizzBuzz`, but it's clear that fuller testing
would be convoluted in the current form e.g. trying to establish that `FizzBuzz` will return an error if `fmt.Fprintf`
returns an error; this suggests we could decompose the function into independent components that are more easily tested.

It would also seem prudent to explicitly codify the contract `FizzBuzz` will satisfy.
