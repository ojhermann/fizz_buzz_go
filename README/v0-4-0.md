# v0.4.0

`interfaces.DivisionGame` establishes the contract with the general format of fizz buzz

- `ToString`: given some dividend, a special string or string representation of the integer is returned
- `Display`: for all values in the range defined by start and end, each `ToString` value is displayed

`implementations.DivisionGame` is implements the game in a way that makes it easy to create a game of fizz buzz (or
any similar game).
