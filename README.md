# fizz_buzz_go

This repo contains code in [Go](https://go.dev/) representing [fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

I like [Tom Scott's take on fizz buzz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc) and thought it would be fun to
create a direct implementation of the game and then make marginal changes to modify the code in ways that make it better
represent production-level code I would like to see in a Go application.

I'll track this iterative process via [releases](https://github.com/ojhermann/fizz_buzz_go/releases), including a
corresponding `README`.
