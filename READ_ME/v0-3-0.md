# v0.3.0

`interfaces.Compare` is an abstraction for comparing to items of the same type; `implementations.IsDivisble`, for
example, satisfies this interface. While it's unlikely this exercise will develop into a library where abstractions will
have broad utility, it will prove useful as a parameter in other functions and structs, especially in unit testing,
where we can pass implementations that always return a desired value.

`interfaces.Divisor` models the behaviour we expect from a divisor in fizz buzz (if it divides a number, that number
should be represented by a string), while `implementations.Divisor` creates a struct that will do this
in `implementations.FizzBuzz`.
